# Design Patterns Project

This multi-module project explores design patterns and includes a test framework for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Selenium and Rest Assured.

## Overview

In software engineering, design patterns provide proven solutions to common problems encountered in software design. This project aims to demonstrate the application of various design patterns in real-world scenarios, enhancing the quality and maintainability of software systems.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several modules, each focusing on a specific design pattern or testing framework component. Here is an overview of the modules:

1. **Page Object Model (POM):** This module showcases the Page Object Model design pattern, emphasizing the separation of test code from web page elements. POM enhances code maintainability and reusability.

2. **Page Factory:** A variation of the POM, this module demonstrates the Page Factory design pattern, which helps initialize page objects and locate elements efficiently.

3. **Singleton Pattern:** In this module, the Singleton pattern is implemented to ensure that a class has only one instance, offering a global point of access to it. This is useful for managing global resources like browser instances.

4. **Factory Method Pattern:** The Factory Method design pattern is illustrated here, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects created while adhering to a common interface.

5. **Builder Pattern:** This module explores the Builder pattern, which facilitates the step-by-step construction of complex objects, enhancing flexibility and readability.

6. **Strategy Pattern:** The Strategy pattern is implemented to dynamically select test strategies, such as different test data sources or configurations.

7. **Decorator Pattern:** Here, the Decorator pattern is used to attach additional responsibilities to objects dynamically. This is useful for custom logging, reporting, or assertion capabilities.

8. **Observer Pattern:** The Observer pattern is showcased for implementing event-driven testing or notifying multiple components of test execution status.

9. **Dependency Injection (DI):** DI principles are applied to inject dependencies like test data, configuration, or services into test classes, improving maintainability and reusability.

10. **Chain of Responsibility:** This module demonstrates the Chain of Responsibility pattern, which allows handling various test conditions or exceptions in a modular way.

11. **Composite Pattern:** The Composite pattern is explored for dealing with complex test scenarios involving multiple objects or components.

12. **State Pattern:** The State pattern is used to model test case execution states or test environment states, enabling behavior changes based on internal state.
